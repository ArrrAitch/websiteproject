<h1> Welcome to the RetroPie page</h1>
<p> This site introduces you to RetroPie, a software system that runs on a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and enables you to experience the computing environment of the vintage era (1980-early 2000s), and have fun playing classic games. </p>

<p> There are several main pages - the first give a simpified overview of the idea behind emulation - using software to simulate an entire computer system. Next there's a quick guide to setting up a RetroPie system with an example walkthrough.</p>
</p>

<p> The Raspberry Pi has been around for a while and has gone through several iterations, each more powerful than the last. The system used  on this site is a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 3 Model B</a>, with a gigabyte of memory. There's a more powerful version 4 on the market but the earlier model is still available for a price around the Â£35 mark. My machine was bought a few years ago in a starter pack complete with power supply and microSD card. I put the board in a clear plastic case to keep it safe from dust. One small addition to the computer board was a couple of metal heatsinks covering the main chips. The Pi is a fanless machine but can still get hot, especially if the processor is being heavily worked. The heatsinks help keep the temperature stable. </p>
<p> Typically a Pi will run some version of the <a href="https://www.linux.org/" target="_blank">Linux operating system</a> with a graphical user interface. The most popular Pi OS is called <a href="https://www.raspbian.org/" target=_blank>Raspbian</a>, and is essentially a version of Debian Linux optimised for the Pi's architecture. RetroPie is built on top of the Raspbian distribution and contains various emulator software cores along with the software to provide an easy to use front-end.</p>

<p> In the installation tutorial the process of installing RetroPie will be examined and you will learn how to put together an emulator platform that will enable you to potentially play thousands of games for a relatively low cost and with no specialist knowledge required.</p>
